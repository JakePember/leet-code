 * Link to problem: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/201/introduction-to-array/1147/
 * In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.
 *
 * Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in
 * the array.
 *
 * If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0] Output: 1 Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other
 * number in the array x, 6 is more than twice as big as x. The index of value 6 is 1, so we return
 * 1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4] Output: -1 Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of
 * 3, so we return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * nums will have a length in the range [1, 50]. Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0,
 * 99].
